# The Reforms
In January 2021, the Illinois General Assembly passed House Bill 3653  â€“ an omnibus crime bill known as the Safety, Accountability, Fairness and Equity Act . A part of the Act, referred to as the Pretrial Fairness Act (PFA), fundamentally changes bond court practices and pretrial release in Illinois. The Act abolishes cash bail, prohibits pretrial detention for most defendants, creates new pretrial hearing processes, curtails the conditions that may be placed on defendants released pretrial, and limits revocation and modification of pretrial release.
